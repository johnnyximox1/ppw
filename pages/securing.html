The goal is to protect a properties from any kind of unauthorized entries which is not limited to human entry in property or lock change but also from any kind damages by human, animal, air, water, etc. Securing order typically consist of following task; . If the property is a pre-sale property, the lock on a secondary door (when possible) will be changed so that future preservation work can be completed. When the property is post-sale, all locks are changed and all broken windows and doors boarded. Generally, when securing a property all locks, including deadbolts, will be changed and keyed to a client-specific code. All outbuildings and sheds will be padlocked</p>

Any door except front door and sliding door are secondary door. If there is no secondary door, in that case contractor can change lock on front door.
