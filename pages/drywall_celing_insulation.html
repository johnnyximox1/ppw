                <h3>Regular Drywall or White Board</h3>
                <p>Regular drywall is normally white on one side and brown on the other. It probably is the most
                    economic drywall type and comes in different sizes ranging in thickness from 3/8 inches to
                    one inch. This is the most common type used and is normally available in four by eight foot
                    panels.

                <h3>Green Board Drywall: </h3>
                <p>Green board drywall, also known as moisture-resistant drywall, has a green covering that makes
                    it more resistant to moisture than regular drywall. It is somewhat more expensive, but be aware
                    that it is not waterproof, so don’t use it if it’s going to be in contact with water. It is also often used
                    as a tile backer in limited wet areas such as bathroom and basement walls, plus kitchens, and
                    laundry and utility rooms.

            <div class="row py-5">
                <h3>Blue Board Drywall:
                </h3>
                <p>Blue board drywall is also known as plaster baseboard. Blue board is used for veneer
                    plastering, and the surface paper has special absorption qualities. It has a high water
                    and mold resistance and there are fewer steps involved in veneer plastering. Blue
                    board drywall is not made for mud, tape, or paint. It works extremely well in
                    bathrooms or places with a lot of moisture and helps reduce noise.

                <h3>Paperless Drywall:
                </h3>
                <p>Paperless drywall has been replacing paper drywall. This type of drywall is covered with
                    fiberglass instead of paper, which protects the gypsum board from rot and offers even
                    greater resistance to mold and mildew. The quality of the board is a little tougher than
                    regular drywall, but some construction pros find it easier to cut. Paperless drywall has
                    some slight textures that will require applying joint compound to achieve a smooth clean
                    finish drywall level.

                </h3>
                <p>Purple drywall offers the same advantages as regular drywall, but with superior moisture and mold-resistant characteristics. It can be used with all wall and ceiling applications
                    and is ideally suited where enhanced moisture and mold resistance is desired. If it is going
                    to be in contact with water, this is the one to use.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row py-5">
                <h3>Type X Drywall:
                </h3>
                <p>This is the so-called fire-resistant drywall. Several thicknesses can be used in layers to
                    achieve a higher fire rating. It is harder to cut and work than regular drywall and normally
                    is used in garages, rooms, and apartment buildings, as it is required by several building
                    codes. Type X drywall is made with special noncombustible fibers. It normally comes in
                    5/8-inches thickness and its extra thickness can also improve its soundproofing
                    characteristics. To receive the "Type X" designation, a gypsum board must achieve at
                    least a one-hour fire resistance rating for 5/8-inch board or a 3/4-hour rating for 1/2-inch
                    board in a single layer, nailed on each face of load-bearing wood framing members

                <h3>Soundproof Drywall:
                </h3>
                <p>Soundproof drywall is composed of laminated drywall made with a mix of wood fibers,
                    gypsum, and polymers increasing the STC (sound transmission class).This drywall is denser
                    than regular drywall so it might be a little harder to cut than other types of drywall. Due to
                    its soundproofing characteristics, it is used in areas where noise is a problem or when
                    silence is required in a room. This one might be used in your family room walls or, if you
                    are a musician, it might help you in your music room.

                <h3>Installation process of Drywall in walls and Ceilings</h3>
                <p>Its pretty simple installing drywall in the interior walls and ceilings. Before
                    installing drywalls, have to see whether there is insulation present in the

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>Acoustical ceiling tiles are used to help soundproof a room. They are usually made of
                        fiberglass, and are installed using a drop-ceiling method. This means that metal
                        strapping is installed across the ceiling and the tiles are dropped or hung from the
                        straps, although some brands do make tiles that can snap together without visible
                        straps. Acoustical ceiling panels usually need to be installed by a professional to
                        ensure their acoustical and insulating properties

                <h3>Plastic Ceiling Tiles</h3>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>Plastic ceiling tiles are a lightweight and inexpensive alternative to traditional tin
                        ceiling tiles. The plastic tiles come embossed in a number of different patterns
                        including flowers, wreaths and repeating designs. They can also be used to give a
                        geometric, three-dimensional appearance to the ceiling. These tiles are extremely
                        easy to install for a DIYer. They can be dropped in or nailed up, and you don't need to
                        worry about denting or dinging the tiles. They can be painted in the same finishes a
                        tin ceiling is often displayed in. The biggest pro for plastic ceiling tiles is their cost; they
                        typically run between $1 and $10 a panel, making them very cost effective.

                <h3>Tin Ceiling Tiles</h3>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>True tin ceiling tiles are a beautiful addition to any home. Contrary to what the name
                        implies, most tin ceiling tiles today are made of aluminum, copper or brass. They are
                        usually installed by nailing them up and overlapping the edges of each panel with the
                        next, although they can be dropped-in as well. Their designs are usually repetitive,
                        with scrolls, flowers, vines and geometric patterns being popular. Tin ceiling tiles are a
                        little more difficult to install than plastic, but can still be put up by most homeowners. If
                        you nick or dent a panel, it can be repaired using auto body repair compound and
                        some sculpting.
                        Tin ceiling tiles are more expensive than their plastic look-a-likes, running about $15 to $40
                        a panel.

                <h3>Cork Ceiling Tiles</h3>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>Cork ceiling tiles are an eco-friendly ceiling tile that can also insulate your home. Cork
                        is naturally fire and water resistant, as well as sound absorbing, which makes them a
                        great all-around ceiling tile for many homes. Cork ceiling tiles can be dropped-in or
                        installed using adhesives. They can also be overlapped and installed in decorative
                        patterns and designs. Some experienced homeowners may find them easy to work
                        with, but most homeowners may prefer to have this type of tile installed by
                        professionals.
                        Cork ceiling tiles are mid-range priced, running about $5 a tile.

                <p>The purpose of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/types-insulation">Insulation</a> is to slow the rate of heat transfer. This is true in both
                    hot and cold climates. In cold climates, it is intended to stop the flow of heat
                    out of the building. In hot climates, its purpose is to slow the movement of heat
                    into the building.
